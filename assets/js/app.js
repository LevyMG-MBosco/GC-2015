  "nav13":"<img src='assets/imgs/DiamondHeader.jpg' /><h1>Synthetic Diamond Manufacturing</h1><p>General Carbide sets the standard for producing semi-finished diamond compaction tooling. Our carbide grades feature long life cycles due to the double hot isostatic pressing (HIP) process the material undergoes. In fact, we sinter all of our products in a Sinter-HIP Furnace where the simultaneous application of heat and pressure fully consolidate the material’s microstructure.</p><p>After leaving the furnace, our diamond compaction anvils undergo separate post-sintering treatment. They are then Sinter-HIPed again under higher pressure and at temperatures that almost reach the original sintering temperature. This process ensures that the material has no residual voids or flaws and can deliver a higher degree of performance than comparable materials.</p><h2>Outstanding Surfaces, Too</h2><p>We also supply carbide substrates and backup discs, pressing and sintering substrates with intricate surface configurations built into the press tooling. The substrates upon which the polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is sintered are proven products that can withstand extremely high compressive loading, as well as fatigue from the cyclical action of the press.</p><p>Our superior ultrasonic cleaning operation, which includes a proprietary cleaning solution, provides a surface finish condition receptive to the PCD table without pre-cleaning and makes brazing easier. </p>"
