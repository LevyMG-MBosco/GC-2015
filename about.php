              <h3>General Carbide establishes the  Premo J. Pappafava Excellence Award</h3>
              <h4>Recognizing the Accomplishments of Family-Owned Manufacturers</h4>
              <p>Named in memory of its founder, the inaugural award was presented at the 2013 Pittsburgh Business Times’ Manufacturer of the Year event.</p>
              <p>This honor will be given to multigenerational, family-owned manufacturers for their excellence, innovation, ethics and philanthropy — the foundation upon which Premo built his life.</p>
              <p>From his humble beginnings, the Carnegie Tech graduate established General Carbide in 1968. The family owned company continues to thrive today under the leadership of Premo's eldest daughter, Mona Pappafava-Ray. Premo showed all who had the honor of knowing him that it is possible to consistently do well and make a difference. That legacy is the essence of this enduring tribute.</p>
