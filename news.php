            <p>October 23, 2014</p>
            <p>GCC became part of the "Ice Bucket Challenge" social media phenomenon by raising $1,000 to
                help find a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), better known as Lou Gehrigʼs Disease.
                Employees donated $400, and Mona Pappafava-Ray, president & CEO, matched employee
                 contributions with a $600 donation to the ALS Association in the companyʼs name. The two
                 highest donors won the privilege of dumping water on their bosses. Mark Klingensmith, manager
                 of technical sales, doused Mona and Dave Fleming, production supervisor, gave Trevor
                 Dunthorne, COO, a mid-day shower.</p>
            <p>The fight against ALS is personal for Trevor because his sister, Julie, has the disease.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>July 30, 2014</p>
            <p>General Carbide Corporation, a manufacturer of more than 50 grades of tungsten carbide tooling
               for a variety of industrial wear, metal forming and stamping applications, has earned ISO
               certification. Until now, the company had been ISO-compliant. General Carbide’s desire to obtain
               ISO certification results from the company’s ongoing commitment to improve its quality systems
               and processes. By doing so, General Carbide can serve customers more effectively than ever
              and continue to grow by taking advantage of new business opportunities in a range of markets,
               including automotive, oil & gas, and aerospace.</p>
            <p>“I am pleased that we have made this significant investment in our future,” says Mona PappafavaRay,
                General Carbide’s president and CEO. “Being ISO-certified ensures our customers that we
                 have an effective quality system in-place. It also enables us to develop business opportunities in
                 markets that were difficult to penetrate without certification. Becoming ISO-certified is a natural
                 extension of our ongoing investments in production equipment, enterprise resource planning
                 systems and information technology.”</p>
            <p>Ms. Pappafava-Ray also believes that by standardizing continual improvement processes,
               corrective and preventive procedures, and customer feedback mechanisms, General Carbide’s
               customers will experience superior product consistency and order turnaround time.</p>
            <p>The company’s ISO certification occurs at a time when sales have been strong for almost five
               years. “The fact that we have out-performed our competition is a testament to the hard work and
               dedication of our management team and production staff,” says Ms. Pappafava-Ray. “Obtaining
              ISO certification strengthens our competitive advantage by complementing the innovative
               thinking, technical expertise and personalized service that have allowed us to thrive in
               challenging times.”</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <h2>Tyler Courtney, Westmoreland County Commissioner, to deliver proclamation</h2>
            <p>July 25, 2013</p>
            <p>Greensburg, PA, July 25, 2013 — General Carbide Corporation, a manufacturer of more than 50
               grades of tungsten carbide tooling for a variety of cutting and metal forming applications, will be
               observing its 45th anniversary with a picnic at the company's Hempfield Township facility (1151
               Garden Street; Greensburg, PA 15601) on Friday, July 26, from 12:00 noon-3:00 p.m. Tyler
               Courtney, a Westmoreland County Commissioner, will be delivering a proclamation to
               acknowledge the company's longevity, and its position as a market leader for nearly half a
               century. Commissioner Courtney will present the proclamation to Lorraine Pappafava, whose
               late husband, Premo, started the company in 1968.</p>
            <p>“This occasion is all about family,” says Mona Pappafava-Ray, General Carbide's president and
               CEO. “A number of our employees have been with us for 20, 30 or 40 years. There's a long
               history with them, and it makes me proud that they've been so loyal.”</p>
            <p>Ms. Pappafava-Ray has known many of her employees for decades because she has been with
               the company full-time since 1986, upon graduating from Carnegie Mellon University with a
               degree in Industrial Management. Before Ms Pappafava-Ray became president 20 years ago
               and added CEO to her responsibilities 11 years ago, when her father passed away, she held a
               variety of staff and management positions in the organization.</p>
            <p>To acknowledge the contributions that General Carbide's 200 employees have made to the
               company's success, Ms. Pappafava-Ray is giving each of them a logo jacket, a card inscribed
               with a handwritten personalized message.</p>
            <p>When it comes to giving workers the necessary tools to succeed, Ms. Pappafava-Ray spares no
               expense. “Every year, we invest at least $1 million in our facilities because it's the only way to
               stay competitive,” she says. This year, however, General Carbide has purchased $2 million
               worth of lathes, presses and other machinery. “It's more than we usually dedicate to capital
               equipment, but it's money well-spent to ensure that we continue to operate efficiently.”</p>
            <p>Since the company's humble beginnings, General Carbide has given back to the community by
               supporting a variety of civic, cultural, educational and religious organizations. Today, the
               company directs the majority of its philanthropy to Westmoreland County Community College,
               the Westmoreland Cultural Trust and Westmoreland Excela Health.</p>
            <p>Mike Langer, president of the Westmoreland Cultural Trust, is appreciative of the company's
               interest in the organization he heads. “Mona is the epitome of balance between work ethic,
               devotion to family, and service to the community. The Trust and Westmoreland County have
               benefitted greatly from her presence and commitment.” The Trust manages community assets
               and promotes the arts and culture throughout Westmoreland County.</p>
            <p>“Continuing in the footsteps of her late father, Premo Pappafava, a longtime member of the Westmoreland County Community College (WCCC) Educational Foundation, Mona has adopted
               the belief that education is a positive way to affect someone's life,'” adds Daniel Obara, WCCC's
               president. “We are grateful for General Carbide's ongoing support of the WCCC Foundation
               Scholarship Golf Classic which raises funds to provide scholarships for many students in pursuit
               of their educational goals.”</p>
            <p>At the regional level, General Carbide, in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Business Times,
               established the Premo J. Pappafava Excellence Award last year to recognize the
               accomplishments of multi-generational, family-owned manufacturers throughout western
               Pennsylvania, West Virginia and eastern Ohio for their overall excellence, innovation, ethics and
               philanthropy. Beginning this year, the Award will be given annually to a company in the Tri-State
               Area.</p>
            <p>Ms. Pappafava-Ray and her management team also encourage employees to become involved
               in their communities. To promote employees taking on those responsibilities, the company
               provides financial support to non-profit organizations in which employees are involved, such as
               youth sports leagues, scouting and civic groups.</p>
            <p>“People are at their best when they have interests outside of the workplace to balance their lives,”
               says Ms. Pappafava-Ray. “We're proud that we're able to help our employees engage in
               activities they enjoy, and which enhance the quality of life in their communities.”</p>
            <p>Focusing inward, Ms. Pappafava-Ray honors employees at the company's annual family picnic
               for their service to the company. “It's important that our employees their families know how much
               we appreciate their contributions to our success,” she says. This year's family picnic will be held
               on Sunday, August 11, at Idlewild Park.</p>
            <p><span class="red-text">Taking Care of “Family”</span></p>
            <p>General Carbide has always prided itself on having a “family atmosphere” where people enjoy
               working and take tremendous pride in their work. Ms. Pappafava-Ray demonstrated that attitude
               by weathering the recession without choosing to lay off any employees. Instead, she reduced
               salaries and wages from 10 to 30 percent, including her own, between October 2008 and
               September 2009. This bold decision was a risk, not knowing how long the recession would last.
               She knew, however, that a long-term commitment to her employees would pay off when
               business conditions improved, largely due to the management team and production employees
               working aggressively to develop new business opportunities when production levels were low.</p>
            <p>The financial implications were great, and a slow recovery would have been detrimental to the
               bottom line, and to the company's survival. Instead, General Carbide has been well-prepared to
               take advantage of new opportunities due to the workforce remaining intact, and then expanding,
               while many competitors cut their employment levels, or went out of business altogether.</p>
            <p>In appreciation of employees' loyalty during difficult times, Ms. Pappafava-Ray gave back part of
               the salaries and wages in December 2010 which were sacrificed in 2008-09, providing an
               unexpected “Christmas bonus” to the company's salaried employees. As orders continued to
               climb during the first half of calendar year 2011, Ms. Pappafava-Ray gave back the remaining
               amounts of salaries and wage cuts in mid-June of 2011, pleasantly surprising employees once
               again by completely repaying them for their lost wages.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>May 2, 2012</p>
            <p>In a ceremony held recently in the Lexus Club at PNC Park, General Carbide Corp. achieved an
               important win as Mona Pappafava-Ray, the company's president and CEO, received a Diamond
               Award from the Pittsburgh Business Times. The honor is in recognition of her leadership,
               customer service philosophy, relationship with employees and community involvement.</p>
            <p>“I am extremely proud to receive the Diamond Award, but I did not do it alone,” says Ms.
               Pappafava-Ray, whose company manufactures more than 50 grades of tungsten carbide for a
               variety of industrial wear and metal forming applications. “This award really belongs to everyone
               at General Carbide because our success is a result of everybody working together each day to
               meet our customers' needs. I am fortunate to be leading a team of dedicated professionals who
               take a great deal of pride in everything they do.”</p>
            <p>To help ensure that employees have the best available resources to carry out their
               responsibilities, the company invests more than $1 million in capital improvements each year.</p>
            <p>Ms. Pappafava-Ray has been with General Carbide for 26 years, after graduating from Carnegie
               Mellon University with a degree in industrial management. Her first assignment when working for
               her father, Premo Pappafava, was to set up a computer inventory system for the company.</p>
            <p>“From the beginning, I had to learn about all the different sections of the plant, and the jobs being
               performed in those areas,” says Ms. Pappafava-Ray. “It was great training because 26 years
               later, there are things I learned then that I use in my decision-making today.”</p>
            <p>Challenging the Conventional Wisdom</p>
            <p>One of the most important decisions she has made in her ten years of running the company was
               to weather the recession without choosing to lay off any employees. Instead, Ms. Pappafava-Ray
               reduced salaries and wages from 10 to 30 percent, including her own, between October 2008
               and September 2009. This bold decision was a risk, not knowing how long the recession would
               last. She knew, however, that a long-term commitment to her employees would pay off when
               business conditions improved, largely due to the management team and production employees
               working aggressively to develop new business opportunities when production levels were low.</p>
            <p>The financial implications were great, and a slow recovery would have been detrimental to the
               bottom line, and to the company's survival. Instead, General Carbide has been well-prepared to
               take advantage of new opportunities due to the workforce remaining intact while many
               competitors have cut their employment levels, or have gone out of business altogether.</p>
            <p>In appreciation of employees' loyalty during difficult times, Ms. Pappafava-Ray gave back part of
               the salaries and wages in December 2010 which were sacrificed in 2008-09, providing an
               unexpected “Christmas bonus” to the company's salaried employees. As orders continued to
               climb during the first half of calendar year 2011, Ms. Pappafava-Ray gave back the remaining  amounts of salaries and wage cuts in mid-June of that year, pleasantly surprising employees
               once again by completely repaying them for their lost wages.</p>
            <p>Ms. Pappafava-Ray's commitment to the local community parallels her concern for her
               employees. Her involvement includes support of the Westmoreland Community College
               Scholarship Program; serving on the board of the Westmoreland Cultural Trust; support of
               Excela Health's Westmoreland Hospital Foundation's Hospice Program; and membership in the
               Young Presidents Organization, Pittsburgh Chapter.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>May 1, 2012</p>
            <p>General Carbide achieved initial certification in 2008 from the Women's Business Enterprise
               National Council (WBENC) as a woman-owned business and was re-certified in 2012. This
               organization is a nationally recognized certifying agency for women's business enterprises
               (WBE). WBENC also links suppliers to buyers through networking seminars, mailing lists and
               regional meetings. Supplier diversity offices of major corporations are looking to engage WBE's
               to fulfill established corporate purchasing targets and General Carbide hopes to be able to
               supply these companies now as an official WBE.</p>
            <p>General Carbide started in 1968 as a supplier to the metalforming industry, making tungsten
               carbide tooling blanks for the manufacture of fasteners and automotive parts. It has diversified
               significantly since then, servicing a wide range of industries from oil/gas exploration and
               production to electronic stamping dies to wear resistant components for general industrial
               applications. General Carbide manufactures tungsten carbide preformed blanks and finished
               components at its facilities located in Greensburg, PA.</p>
